  "root_cause_detailed": "In Node.js projects, the 'npm test' command looks for a 'test' script in the package.json file. If this script is not defined, npm returns an error 'no test specified'. This error is propagated to the CI/CD pipeline, causing the build to fail. The absence of this script suggests that either tests haven't been set up for the project, or the configuration to run existing tests is missing.",
