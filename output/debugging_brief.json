This error occurs when the syntax of the code violates the rules of the JavaScript language. In this case, the error message 'missing ) after argument list' indicates that a function call is missing its closing parenthesis. The error is located on line 6 of index.js, where the res.send() function is called with the 'Hello there' argument.",
